# student-magazine-ux-case-study
Created a student magazine website from scratch, designing desktop &amp; mobile versions that are creative, engaging, usable, and accessible, with research, sketches, prototypes, user testing, and enhancements.

This project involved creating a student magazine website entirely from scratch, with the goal of designing a creative, visually engaging, and user-friendly experience. Both desktop and mobile versions were designed to ensure accessibility and seamless use across devices.

# UX Process

- Desk Research & Sketches – Explored user needs, inspiration, and potential pain points.
- Empathy Map & User Journey Map – Visualizing user motivations, goals, and pain points throughout the experience.
- Low-Fidelity Wireframes – Defined layout, navigation, and content structure.
- High-Fidelity Prototypes – Developed polished, interactive designs in Figma.
- User Testing (Think-Aloud Sessions) – Gathered feedback and iterated on designs.
- Enhanced Version – Implemented improvements for a final, fully original, usable website.

The project demonstrates the full UX workflow from initial concept to final prototype.
